# RT-VCR
Real Time Vocal Conditioning Regimen: A hardware-software suite used to classically condition vocal usage and vocal modification by an animal

This project aims to develope a system in which mice (or other animals) could be trained to modify their vocal behavior for a food reward. By adapting innate vocal behaviors in this functional manner, one could explore vocal usage learning or vocal production learning (Petkov and Jarvis, 2012) in a species of interest.

Signficant parts of this project have been tied in from various sources and are highlighted below:

**1) AMVOC - Analysis of Mouse Vocal Communication:**
[AMVOC]((https://github.com/tyiannak/amvoc)) is a collaboration between the Jarvis Lab and the [Multimedia Analysis Group](https://labs-repos.iit.demokritos.gr/MagCIL/about.html) at NCSR-Demoktritos headed by [Dr. Theodoros Giannakopoulos](https://tyiannak.github.io/). AMVOC provides several functionalities for researchers studying ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), one of which is the ability to detect USVs in real time. More information can be found in our [preprint on BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.456283v1)

**2) FED - Feeding Experimental Device**
[FED](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3) is a project out of the Kravitz lab at WashU-St. Louis. The FED provides the
